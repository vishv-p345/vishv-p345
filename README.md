#Cold World   by: Eric Repid



My head so messed up but I can't fold to no fear
Got sights set right up on these bands that I'm gon' use to wipe tears
Five years still stickin' to the plans I made when I was a jit
Told moms I can't go live no normal life, won't stop 'til I'm rich
Said where were you when I was down bad
Now the money comin' to me so fast
Left the hoe, she a big dub straight forward with it, I won't go back
Everybody livin' better, I still remember times we done broke down
Plotted on this come up, I gotta get a bag for the fam now but
I got nobody to lean on, got a cold hеart in a cold world
Ever since you left I don't know what's nеxt, I ain't found closure
I keep a knife in my chest just to cut hoes off, I don't know 'em
Leavin' a bitch in the past, I gotta go now it's over
Left me out here grievin'
Shit don't add up, baby, I'ma get even
It's a cold world, baby, and I'm just gettin' heated
Said I'm the only one I ever really needed...
